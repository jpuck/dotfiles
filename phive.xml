  <!-- PHIVE CONFIGURATION -->
  <!--
        By default, PHIVE stores all PHARs and some additional files containing meta data in ~/.PHIVE.
        You can change the working directory, but it is recommended to stick with it.

        <config home="~/.PHIVE" />
    -->
  <!-- DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT -->
  <!--
        If the dependency you need is listed on https://phar.io, you can simply add the alias to your config.
        Although not recommended, you can leave out the version attribute, so the newest available version will
        be installed.

        <phar name="phpunit" version="4.6.*" />
    -->
  <!--
        If the dependency you need is not listed on https://phar.io or you do not want to rely on a central database,
        you can also add an URL pointing to any PHAR to your config.

        <phar url="https://some.tld/tool.phar" />
    -->
  <phar name="carbon" version="^1.0.0" installed="1.0.0" location="./tools/carbon"/>
